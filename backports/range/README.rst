backports.range class from Python 3.3
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|pypi| |travis| |codecov|

Backports the python 3.X `range` class as a replacement for python 2.X `range`
functions. The `range` class is similar to `xrange` in that its values are
computed on demand - however, the `range` class is actually a lazy sequence:
it supports indexing, membership testing and other sequence features.

Features
--------

This implementation provides all features introduced and documented in
python 3.3.

All objects are available by default in a pure python implementation.
In addition, there are optional, optimized implementations using `Cython`_.

Cython Optimizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All `Cython`_ optimizations are optional.
They are automatically made available if `Cython`_ is installed.

Compatibility
-------------

- Features are tested against the Python 3.6 unittests for `range`.

- The following python versions are tested explicitly:

  - cpython (aka python): 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5

  - Cython: All versions supported by cpython

  - pypy: pypy2, pypy3

- Some features depending on language features or other modules may not be
  available or work differently:

  - Comparing `range` against other types does not throw `TypeError` in python 2.X.
